                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hearthstone is a free-to-play online digital collectible card game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Personally speaking, 
                    HearthStone is the first Blizzard video game I played. When I first found this game, I was amazed by 9 different classes and thousands of cards.
                    Whatâ€™s more, there are so many abilities for players to find out.

                <h2>How to play</h2>
                <p>In game, player needs to choose one class and have battle with a real or AI player. You need to create a deck before the battle, which conta
                    ins 30 cards. Basically, there are two types of cards: minions and spells. Arrange your deck carefully and use unique strategies to defeat your 
                    opponent. Every few months, there will be hundreds of new cards available.
