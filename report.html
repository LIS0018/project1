        <p>How do I meet those requirements (listed by expectations)</p>
            <p> 1.	In this assignment, my clients are my friends. I want to share some video games with them.</p>
                <p>  2.	In each page, there is a header section. You can find it on the top-left, which background color is blue.</p>
                    <p>  3.	I have 5 pages: index page; page for Overwatch; page for StarCraft; page for Hearthstone and page for Heroes of the Storm.</p>
                        <p>  4.	In the index page, I use four pictures for navigation. On the other four pages, the navigation bar is near the top.</p>
                            <p> 5.	I have tested big and small screens. Also, I use media queries.</p>
                                <p>  6.	Global style rules are in the file named “global.css” and the rest of the CSS files have individual pages’ style rules.</p>
                                <p> 7.	As you can see, there are plenty of images and I have their “alt” attributes.</p>
                                <p>  8.	I think my pages have the favicon.</p>
                                <p> 9.	Images are placed in a directory named images. CSS files are placed in a directory named css. JavaScript are placed in a directory named js.</p>
                                <p> 10.	No libraries or frameworks.</p>
                                <p> 11.	I have them checked on both HTML validator and CSS validator.</p>
                                <p> 12.	The site is stored in a Git repository and I have shared it with you.</p>
                                <p>  13.	The names of the files are entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.</p>
                                <p> 14.	It is on port 8443.</p>
                                <p> 15.	The site must be accessed only through HTTPS.</p>
                                <p> 16.	The content is neatly aligned and the axes are clearly visible.</p>
                                <p> 17.	As you can see, there are different font faces. For example, on the index page, the font faces of the heading, introduction text and text in the images are different.</p>
                                <p>18.	The form is on the index page. You can put some text in it. There is a submit button but I have no server to collect the data.</p>
                                <p>19.	At the bottom of page3 and page4, there is footer and there are links to external sites.</p>
                                <p> 20.	I don’t think it is hard to read my code.</p>
            <p> 21.	The animation is on the StarCraft page (page3). I use JavaScript to make an image gallery. It can switch images automatically.
